/** 
 * This class handles sending of RoleRequest messages to all connected switches.
 * 
 * Handling Role Requests is tricky. Roles are hard state on the switch and
 * we can't query it so we need to make sure that we have consistent states
 * on the switches. Whenever we send a role request to the set of connected 
 * switches we need to make sure that we've sent the request to all of them 
 * before we process the next change request. If a new switch connects, we 
 * need to send it the current role and need to make sure that the current
 * role doesn't change while we are doing it. We achieve this by synchronizing
 * all these actions on Controller.roleChanger
 * On the receive side: we need to make sure that we receive a reply for each 
 * request we send and that the reply is consistent with the request we sent. 
 * We'd also like to send the role request to the switch asynchronously in a
 * separate thread so we don't block the REST API or other callers.
 * 
 * There are potential ways to relax these synchronization requirements:
 * - "Generation ID" for each role request. However, this would be most useful
 *   if it were global for the whole cluster
 * - Regularly resend the controller's current role. Don't know whether this
 *   might have adverse effects on the switch. 
 *   
 * Caveats:
 * - No way to know if another controller (not in our controller cluster) 
 *   sends MASTER requests to connected switches. Then we would drop to
 *   slave role without knowing it. Could regularly resend the current role. 
 *   Ideally the switch would notify us if it demoted us. What happens if
 *   the other controller also regularly resends the same role request? 
 *   Or if the health check determines that
 *   a controller is dead but the controller is still talking to switches (maybe
 *   just its health check failed) and resending the master role request.... 
 *   We could try to detect if a switch demoted us to slave even if we think
 *   we are master (error messages on packet outs, e.g., when sending LLDPs)
 * 
 *
 * The general model of Role Request handling is as follows:
 * 
 * - All role request messages are handled by this class. Class Controller 
 *   submits a role change request and the request gets queued. submitRequest
 *   takes a Collection of switches to which to send the request. We make a copy
 *   of this list. 
 * - A thread takes these change requests from the queue and sends them to 
 *   all the switches (using our copy of the switch list). 
 * - The OFSwitchImpl sends the request over the wire and puts the request
 *   into a queue of pending request (storing xid and role). We start a timeout 
 *   to make sure we eventually receive a reply from the switch. We use a single
 *   timeout for each request submitted using submitRequest()
 * - After the timeout triggers we go over the list of switches again and
 *   check that a response has been received (by checking the head of the 
 *   OFSwitchImpl's queue of pending requests)
 * - We handle requests and timeouts in the same thread. We use a priority queue
 *   to schedule them so we are guaranteed that they are processed in 
 *   the same order as they are submitted. If a request times out we assume
 *   the switch doesn't support HA role (the same as receiving an error reply). 
 * - Since we decouple submission of role change requests and actually sending
 *   them we cannot check a received role reply against the controller's current 
 *   role because the controller's current role could have changed again. 
 * - Receiving Role Reply messages is received by OFChannelHandler and
 *   delivered here. We call switch's setHARole() to mark the switch role and
 *   indicate that a reply was received. Next, we call addSwitch(),
 *   removeSwitch() to update the list of active switches if appropriate.
 * - If we receive an Error indicating that roles are not supported by the 
 *   switch, we set the SWITCH_SUPPORTS_NX_ROLE to false. We call switch's
 *   setHARole(), indicating no reply was received. We keep the switch
 *   connection alive while in MASTER and EQUAL role. 
 *   (TODO: is this the right behavior for EQUAL??). If the role changes to
 *   SLAVE the switch connection is dropped (remember: only if the switch
 *   doesn't support role requests)  
 *   The expected behavior is that the switch will probably try to reconnect
 *   repeatedly (with some sort of exponential backoff), but after a  while 
 *   will give-up and move on to the next controller-IP configured on the 
 *   switch. This is the serial failover mechanism from OpenFlow spec v1.0.
 *   
 * New switch connection:
 * - Switch handshake is done without sending any role request messages.
 * - After handshake completes, switch is added to the list of connected switches
 *   and we send the first role request message. If role is disabled, we assume
 *   the role is MASTER.
 * - When we receive the first reply we proceed as above. In addition, if
 *   the role request is for MASTER we wipe the flow table.
